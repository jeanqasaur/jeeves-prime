Logic Programming

1.  What are some advantages of using logic programming?  (What kinds of problems might logic programs be useful for solving?)  Disadvantages?
Programming errors are found during compile time in logic programming languages.  Because of this, more information about the problem can be obtained.
Some disadvantages of logic programming languages are slowness of program execution and complexity of programs.
Logic programming languages are better to solve non-numeric problems, as their execution speed is slower than that of other types of languages.

Planner, Golux, Prolog, ALF, Fril, Godel, Mercury, Oz, Ciao, Visual Prolog, XSB, and LambdaProlog.
